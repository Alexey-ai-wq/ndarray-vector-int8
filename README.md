## Introduction

The **ndarray-vector-int8** library is designed for developers who need a simple way to work with signed 8-bit integer vectors in JavaScript. This library provides an efficient way to handle numerical data in applications such as data analysis, machine learning, and more. 

## Installation

To get started with **ndarray-vector-int8**, you need to install it via npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install ndarray-vector-int8
```

Once installed, you can begin using the library in your project.

## Usage

After installing the library, you can create a signed 8-bit integer vector. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to do this:

```javascript
const Int8Vector = require('ndarray-vector-int8');

// Create a new vector
const vector = new Int8Vector([1, -2, 3, -4, 5]);

console.log(vector); // Output: Int8Vector [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]
```

## API Reference

### Constructor

The main constructor for creating a signed 8-bit integer vector is `Int8Vector`. You can initialize it with an array of numbers.

#### Syntax

```javascript
new Int8Vector(data)
```

- **data**: An array of numbers to initialize the vector.

### Methods

- **get(index)**: Returns the value at the specified index.
- **set(index, value)**: Sets the value at the specified index.
- **length()**: Returns the length of the vector.

### Example

```javascript
const vector = new Int8Vector([1, -2, 3]);

console.log(vector.get(0)); // Output: 1
vector.set(1, 4);
console.log(vector.get(1)); // Output: 4
console.log(vector.length()); // Output: 3
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples demonstrating the functionality of the **ndarray-vector-int8** library:

### Example 1: Creating a Vector

```javascript
const Int8Vector = require('ndarray-vector-int8');

const vector = new Int8Vector([-5, 10, 15]);
console.log(vector); // Output: Int8Vector [-5, 10, 15]
```

### Example 2: Accessing Elements

```javascript
const vector = new Int8Vector([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]);

console.log(vector.get(2)); // Output: 2
```

### Example 3: Modifying Elements

```javascript
const vector = new Int8Vector([5, 10, 15]);

vector.set(1, 20);
console.log(vector.get(1)); // Output: 20
```
